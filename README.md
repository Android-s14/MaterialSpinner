# MaterialSpinner

Fork of the [MaterialSpinner](https://github.com/ganfra/MaterialSpinner) with an ability to set floating label to be showed constantly (primarily when 0th item is selected in the spinner, which is not the case in the original library).

##Usage

Obtainable from:

```groovy
compile 'com.github.android-s14:material-spinner:1.0.3'
```

```java
spinner.setShowFloatingLabelAlways(true);
```
